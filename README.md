ZoneSnap is a location based picture contest in where users virtually drop pictures in a zone.

A zone is comprised of 316' x 316' piece of the world that can be located anywhere. When a user enters a zone, they will be able to view the pictures dropped in that zone. The user can "like" the photo, hence the zone-based picture contest to get the most likes.

ZoneSnap uses Facebook for authenication as well as Google Maps for visually searching for pictures.
